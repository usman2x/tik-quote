## Features

- View Quotes by Category
- Like and Save Quotes (stored locally)
- Powerful Keyword Search
- On-Demand Sync with JSON Data
- Clean & Adaptive Jetpack Compose UI

## Backend (Quotes Server)

For simplicity and offline-first approach:

- Quotes are fetched from a **static JSON file** stored locally or hosted on GitHub.
- On first app launch or manual sync, existing DB records are compared, and only new quotes are added (preserving likes/saves).
- JSON is parsed via Retrofit with a simple `@GET` endpoint for fetching the quote list.

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "text": "Your heart is the size of an ocean...",
    "author": "Rumi",
    "category": "Love"
  }
]
````


## Setup & Run
